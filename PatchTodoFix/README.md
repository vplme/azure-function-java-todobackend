# PatchTodoFix

Azure Functions Java annotations do not have the "PATCH" method in the HttpMethod enum that is used to generate the `function.json` file which is needed for an Azure Function to run.

Instead we are manually editing this file and overriding the file that is generated by Azure Functions tooling. This means we need to use Maven instead of any integrated tooling if we want the Patch request to be a success.

```
mvn clean package azure-functions:deploy
```
